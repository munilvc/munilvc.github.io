Notice:
This is just my personal AngularJS refresher. In other words these are some of my notes while taking the AngularJS course at codeschool.com.  
So not all of this is my stuff but it can help you as a refresher too, if you are looking for a great intro to AngularJS I highly encourage you to follow the course itself at codeschool.com.

# Some theory:
- Directives: HTML annotations that trigger js behavior. Many useful directives are provided by angularJS.
- Modules: Where app components live. Help to organize and encapsulate code.
- Controllers: Where we define app behavior by defining functions and values.
- Expressions:  '''{{...}}''' stuff.

## Angular claims to be MVW:  
- Model (ClientSide Model shared by Model and Whatever)
- View (Where we use HTML, Directives, Modules, Expressions) 
- Whatever (Where we define Controllers, Modules, Directives)
